# BookScrapper
A scrapper for getting books from loveread.ec in fb2 format.

### How-to

Go to the `const.py` and change values for variables:
```
BOOK_ID = 2039
BOOK_NAME = "451 градус по Фаренгейту"
BOOK_AUTHOR = "Рэй Брэдбери"
```

Then save the file and run:
```
python LoveReadtoFB2.py
```

Enjoy your book in the same directory!

### To be done in future:
* cover fix
* notes
* levels of titles
* epigraphs
* using only book_id
